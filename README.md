## § Design Philosophy & Architecture
<br>

### ¶ Core Design Principles

<br>

- **Expressive and Intentional**  
   Styling choices should serve as self-documenting expressions of design intention, ensuring intuitive understanding and long-term maintainability.

- **Consistency and Consideration**  
   The design system is the single source of truth, rigorously upheld through strict typing and compile-time validation to eliminate off-scale values and unauthorized modifications. 

- **Extensible and Reliable**  
   The system must support growth and adaptation while maintaining simplicity, with styling validated before runtime to guarantee alignment with the design system on every build.

<br>

### ¶ Current Capabilities



- Responsive design syntax
- Context-based styling
- Breakpoint-aware class generation
- Intelligent buffer/container management
- Comprehensive design token system

<br>

### ¶ Architectural Approach



**Key Technical Innovations:**
- **Compile-Time Parsing**: Uses Chevrotain for robust class attribute tokenization
- **Mobile-First Design**: Intelligent breakpoint processing
- **Declarative Syntax**: Transforms HTML class attributes into optimized CSS

**Parsing Strategy:**
1. **File Scanning**: Discover class attributes across project files
2. **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenize class strings
3. **Syntax Parsing**: Convert syntax to Concrete Syntax Trees (CST)
4. **CSS Generation**: Transform CST into optimized CSS

**Type Safety:**
- Strict token definitions of design system as well as property-attribute relationships
- Compile-time validation of design system tokens and relationships to CSS
- TypeScript type constraints for design system tokens

<br>

### ¶ Performance Characteristics



**Compilation Approach:**
- Generate static CSS at compile-time
- Transforms HTML class attributes into optimized CSS
- Zero runtime JavaScript overhead
- No tree shaking necessary

<br>

## § Syntax and Usage

<br>

### ¶ Quick Start

<br>

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile to CSS
npm start
```

<br>

### ¶ Syntax Guide

<br>

**Basic Usage:**  

At the heart of the syntax are "utility strings", which are used to describe styling. 

<br>

**Direct Properties:**  

Define a single property with a value. Generally used for layout and positioning.

```html
<div class="block"> <!-- display: block -->
```

<br>

**Compound Properties:** 

Build complex class definitions by chaining modifiers:

```html
<div class="property:modifier:modifier:modifier">      
```
<br>

**Practical Examples:**

```html
<div class="text:bold:purple">      <!-- Bold text with purple color -->
<div class="color:purple">          <!-- Element color set to purple -->
<div class="row:x-center:y-start">  <!-- Row layout with specific alignment -->
<div class="absolute left:d12 z:10">  <!-- Absolute positioning, d12 from the left, and z-index of 10  -->
```
<br>

**※ Order of Modifiers:**  

The order generally doesn't matter unless there's a token type collision. In that case, the first rule matching the token type is used. For multiple modifiers of the same type, Elevate suggests defining a submap in `/maps`. By default, Elevate is structured so that no type collisions can occur.

<br>

### ¶ Responsive Styling

<br>

Elevate enforces a mobile-first, organized syntax for responsive design:

```html
<div class="text:purple /md/ text:right /lg/ @hover:[text:green:right]"> 
```

1. Define universal classes first.
2. Add breakpoint-specific adjustments after a `/breakpoint/` indicator.

<br>

### ¶ Contextual and Functional Flags

<br>

**Contextual Flag [@]:**  

Allows complex, conditional styling for states, conditions, and other pseudo-classes:

```html
<div class="@hover:[text:green:right]">  <!-- Hover state changes text -->
```
<br>

**Functional Flag [$]:**  

Ignore certain classes for CSS generation (e.g. for JavaScript interactions):

```html
<div class="$mySelector">
```

<br>

### ¶ Design Tokens and Rules

<br>

Elevate is powered by two distinct elements:

<br>

**Design System Tokens**
   - Global, immutable design constraints.  
   - Centralized values, enforce system-wide consistency.
<br>

**Mapping Rules**  
   - Property-specific structural validation.  
   - Validate property values, provide type-safe transformations.
   - Allow for syntax extensions and modification through submapping.
<br>

**Pass-Through Tokens**
   - Unrestricted value entry.  
   - No compile-time validation, for dynamic or flexible values.
   - Primarily used for CSS rules that require special syntax (e.g., URLs or complex values).
   - Not recommended for general styling.

<br>

1. **Design System Tokens**  
   - **Purpose:** Global, immutable design constraints.  
   - **Location:** `design/` directory  
   - **Configuration:** `elevate/config/designConfig.ts`
   - **Characteristics:** Centralized values, enforce system-wide consistency.

   **Example:**
   ```typescript
   // design/colors.ts
   export const colors = {
       'purple': '#6665DD',
       'dark':'#2C2638',
       'white':'#F0EFF4',
       'warn':'#FABC2A',
       'error':'#D81E5B'
   } as const;

   export type ColorToken = keyof typeof colors;
   ```

<br>

2. **Mapping Rules**  
   - **Purpose:** Property-specific structural validation.  
   - **Location:** `rules/` directory  
   - **Configuration:** `elevate/maps/propertyAttributeMap.ts` and `elevate/rules`
   - **Characteristics:** Validate property values, provide type-safe transformations, and structure syntax.

   **Example:**
   ```typescript
   // maps/grid.ts
   import { SpacingToken } from '../design/spacing.js';
   import { NumericToken } from '../maps/numeric.js';

   export const grid = {
     gap: {
       "gap-": "SpacingToken"
     },
     row: {
       "row-": "NumericToken" 
     },
     column: {
       "col-": "NumericToken"
     }
   } as const;

   export type GridToken = keyof typeof grid;
   export type GridGapToken = `g-${SpacingToken}`; 
   export type GridRowToken = `r-${NumericToken}`; 
   export type GridColumnToken = `c-${NumericToken}`;
   ```
<br>

   **※ A Very Special Design Token**

   **Pass-Through Tokens** 
   - **Purpose:** Unrestricted value entry.  
   - **Characteristics:** No compile-time validation, for dynamic or flexible values.

   **Example:**
   ```typescript
   // propertyAttributeMap.ts
   rotate: {
     "rotate": "PassThroughToken" // Allows any rotation value
   }
   ```

   ```html
   <div class="rotate:((90deg))"></div>
   ```
<br>

   Please note that you must pass through the value in the same way that you would write it in CSS.
   For example, preserving parentheses for values requiring them (e.g., URLs).

<br>

### ¶ Token Selection Guide

<br>

**Decision Matrix:**
```
Property Characteristics
├── Needs Global Consistency?
│   ├── Yes → Design System Token
│   └── No →
│       ├── Property-Specific Validation Needed?
│       │   ├── Yes → Mapping Rule and Property-Attribute Map Entry
│       │   └── No → PassThrough Token
```
<br>

**※ Design Token Imports**  

You must import relevant design token files if used in a rule to ensure compile-time validation.

<br>

### ¶ Best Practices

<br>

1. Prefer Design System Tokens whenever possible.
2. Use Mapping Rules for structured properties or relationships.
3. Minimize PassThroughToken usage.

<br>

## § Configuration

<br>

### ¶ Framework Configuration



Configure Elevate's general settings in `elevate/config/elevate.ts`:

```typescript
// elevate/config/elevate.ts
const options = {
    Watch:'./',                // Directory to watch for changes
    FileTypes: ['html', 'jsx', 'tsx', 'astro'], // File extensions to scan
    Output:'./'                // Output directory for generated CSS
}

export const config = options
```
<br>

Import and distribute design system tokens in `elevate/config/design.ts`

```typescript
// elevate/config/designConfig.ts
import { colors } from "../design/colors.js";
import { spacing } from "../design/spacing.js";
import { typography } from "../design/typography.js";

export const designSystem = {
    ColorToken: colors,
    SpacingToken: spacing,
    FontSizeToken: typography.size,
    FontFamilyToken: typography.family,
    LineHeightToken: typography.leading,
    LetterSpacingToken: typography.tracking,
    FontWeightToken: typography.weight,
};
```
<br>


### ¶ Extending Elevate: A Comprehensive Guide

Elevate is designed to be extensible and adaptable, allowing you to easily add new features and functionality that help you embody your design system in a way that is both consistent and maintainable.

In order to do so, it provides multiple configurations.

<br>

**※ Included Example**  

By default, Elevate includes a basic example of extending the design system. Please see `example.ts` and `designConfig.ts` for more details.

<br>

#### 1. Token File Creation

**Location:** `elevate/design/`  
**File Naming Convention:** Use a descriptive, singular noun (e.g., `brandColors.ts`)

**Example: Brand Color Tokens**
```typescript
export const example = {
    'example':'#39FF14'
} as const

export type ExampleToken = keyof typeof example;
```

**Key Principles:**
- Use `as const` for strict type inference
- Create a type using `keyof typeof`
- Provide clear, descriptive comments
- Limit tokens to a single, cohesive concept

<br>

#### 2. Design System Configuration

**File:** `elevate/config/design.ts`

**Integration Steps:**
```typescript
//Design Token Imports Defined in 'Design' Directory.
import { example } from "../design/example.js";
import { colors } from "../design/colors.js";
import { spacing } from "../design/spacing.js";
import { typography } from "../design/typography.js";

//Token Type Definitions
export const designSystem = {
    ColorToken: { ...colors, ...example },
    SpacingToken: spacing,
    FontSizeToken: typography.size,
    FontFamilyToken: typography.family,
    LineHeightToken: typography.leading,
    LetterSpacingToken: typography.tracking,
    FontWeightToken: typography.weight,
};
```

<br>

#### 3. Mapping Rules

**File:** `elevate/maps/propertyAttributeMap.ts`

**Mapping Strategies:**

**A. Direct Token Mapping**
```typescript

```

**B. Submap for Complex Rule Mappings**
```typescript

```

<br>

#### 4. Token Usage Guidelines 

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use clear, semantic names
- Prefix with the token type (e.g., `BrandColorToken`)
- Avoid generic names that might cause collisions

**Type Safety Checks:**
- Verify token existence before use
- Use TypeScript's type system to prevent runtime errors

**Performance Considerations:**
- Use rules for complex, related tokens or syntactic relationships.
- Minimize the number of token types as possible.


<br>

#### Helpful Tips

**Extension Considerations:**
- As you begin extending Elevate to fit your use case, consider the following:
  1. Design system tokens should always be defined in the design directory and you can spread them in the existing token categories in `elevate/config/design.ts`.
  2. If you're feeling confused about how rules work, examine the existing rules that allow Elevate to work out of the box.
  3. You can effectively create your own use case specific syntax for your project via rules, but do so with care and consideration.

<br>

#### Troubleshooting 

**Common Issues:**
- If a token doesn’t map correctly, verify the following:
  1. The design token is properly **exported** in the token file.
  2. The design token is correctly **imported** in `design.ts`.
  3. All relevant **rules** are updated for your use case.
  4. The design token or subsequent rules are included in **`propertyAttributeMap.ts`**.
  5. Ensure **type consistency** across all definitions.

## § Why Elevate?

<br>

Elevate CSS redefines utility-first frameworks by addressing fundamental shortcomings in traditional approaches while introducing a rigorous, token-driven, compile-time-validated methodology. Unlike other frameworks, Elevate is purpose-built to maintain strict design system adherence, enforce correctness, and enable long-term scalability.

<br>

### ¶ Market Differentiation and Competitive Positioning

Elevate CSS stands apart in the market of CSS frameworks by introducing a novel approach to styling that prioritizes **engineering rigor, design system integrity, and long-term maintainability**. Here's how Elevate differentiates itself:

<br>

#### **From Arbitrary Utilities to Rigorous Token Enforcement**

- **Market Problem:**  
   Popular frameworks like TailwindCSS provide a vast library of atomic utilities but fail to enforce strict adherence to design tokens. Developers often introduce "off-scale" or inconsistent values, degrading the integrity of the design system.

- **Elevate’s Innovation:**  
   At the heart of Elevate CSS is a token-driven architecture. All styles are tied to pre-approved, strictly typed design tokens. These tokens are validated at compile-time, ensuring that every property and modifier reflects the design system with absolute precision. This guarantees consistency across projects and eliminates the guesswork of arbitrary class selections.

**Key Differentiator:**  
Elevate CSS makes design tokens immutable rules, not optional guidelines, elevating the design system to a first-class citizen in your codebase.

 <br>

#### **From Class Bloat to Declarative, Semantic Syntax**

- **Market Problem:**  
   Tailwind-style class stacks often lead to verbose, hard-to-read code (e.g., `bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 text-sm`). This makes it difficult to discern design intent, creating challenges in onboarding, auditing, and maintaining large-scale projects.

- **Elevate’s Innovation:**  
   Elevate employs a concise, property:modifier syntax that inherently maps to pre-approved tokens. Instead of verbose class lists, styles like `text:purple:bold space:y-2` are declarative, semantic, and self-explanatory. This transforms your codebase into a readable, maintainable narrative of design decisions, reducing cognitive overhead.

**Key Differentiator:**  
Elevate’s syntax doubles as living documentation of your design system, making intent visible and self-validating.

<br>

#### **Compile-Time Validation for Guaranteed Correctness**

- **Market Problem:**  
   Frameworks like Tailwind rely on runtime checks or visual testing to catch errors such as misspelled classes (`bg-blu-500`). This leaves room for subtle inconsistencies and styling drift, increasing QA overhead and technical debt.

- **Elevate’s Innovation:**  
   With a compiler-like approach, Elevate validates all classes and tokens at compile-time. Errors such as typos, unauthorized modifiers, or off-scale values fail the build, ensuring that only correct, consistent styles make it to production. This engineering-first mindset eliminates reliance on manual checks.

**Key Differentiator:**  
Elevate CSS enforces correctness by construction, ensuring that styling errors are caught early and automatically.

<br>

#### **From Utility Overload to Structured, Composable Logic**

- **Market Problem:**  
   While Tailwind’s atomic classes are flexible, there’s no inherent conceptual framework guiding how to compose them into meaningful patterns. Teams must rely on conventions or documentation to maintain consistency, which becomes unsustainable at scale.

- **Elevate’s Innovation:**  
   Elevate organizes styles around meaningful categories (e.g., `text`, `space`, `color`) and strictly typed tokens. The framework encourages reuse through property-to-modifier maps, building a coherent styling vocabulary over time. This structured approach promotes maintainability and scalability, particularly for large, complex projects.

**Key Differentiator:**  
Elevate turns ad-hoc class lists into a stable, composable styling system that grows with your project.

<br>

#### **True System Integration at Scale**

- **Market Problem:**  
   As projects evolve, traditional frameworks expand by adding more utilities, often resulting in bloated stylesheets and fragmented design adherence. Without enforcement mechanisms, large teams may struggle to maintain alignment with the design system.

- **Elevate’s Innovation:**  
   Elevate integrates deeply with the design system by treating it as the foundation of all styling decisions. Breakpoints, states, and tokens are managed as typed constants, ensuring that changes propagate coherently throughout the codebase. This enables large teams to scale their design systems without sacrificing consistency.

**Key Differentiator:**  
Elevate CSS grows with your design system, enforcing alignment and coherence as complexity increases.

<br>

#### **Engineering Rigor Meets Front-End Styling**

- **Market Problem:**  
   CSS frameworks have traditionally relied on flexibility and intuition, leaving consistency to human judgment. This creates friction for teams that value type safety, static analysis, and compile-time guarantees.

- **Elevate’s Innovation:**  
   By leveraging TypeScript, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing, and static analysis, Elevate applies engineering principles to front-end styling. Developers gain a predictable, type-safe workflow that aligns with modern software development practices.

**Key Differentiator:**  
Elevate CSS transforms styling into a rigorously engineered system, ensuring long-term maintainability and reliability.

<br>
