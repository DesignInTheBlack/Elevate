# Elevate CSS

A utility CSS framework implementing the EWDS (Enterprise Web Design System) methodology with type-safe parsing and state management. Currently in active development.

## Overview

Elevate CSS aims to bridge the gap between design systems and utility CSS by providing a strongly-typed, enterprise-focused CSS framework. It combines the flexibility of utility classes with the structure and safety needed for large-scale applications.

## Goals

Based on EWDS methodology, Elevate CSS aims to:

1. **Enforce Design Consistency**
   - Strict token-based system for colors, spacing, and typography
   - Validation against design system constraints
   - Type-safe implementation of design tokens

2. **Improve Developer Experience**
   - Clear error messages with design system context
   - Compile-time validation of utility classes
   - Intelligent state management

3. **Enable Design System Integration**
   - Direct mapping to design tokens
   - Structured property-attribute relationships
   - Enterprise-ready type safety

## Current Status

This is an active work in progress. Currently implemented:
- Basic parser and compiler
- File scanning system
- Token validation
- State management
- Breakpoint handling
- Typography properties

## Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Type Safety
- Full TypeScript integration
- Compile-time token validation
- Property and attribute type checking

### üéØ State Management
```css
// State handling
@hover:[text:red]

// Property with modifier
text:large
```

### üì± Mobile-First Design
```html
<!-- Breakpoint syntax -->
<div class="/md/text:large">
  Responsive Text
</div>
```

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **File Scanner** - Searches project files for class attributes
2. **Parser** - Built with Chevrotain for robust tokenization and parsing
3. **AST Generator** - Converts parsed tokens into a structured AST
4. **CSS Generator** - Outputs compiled CSS to `elevate.css`

### Current Property Support

```typescript
// Currently supported properties
text: {
    "font-size": "FontSizeToken",
    "color": "ColorToken",
    "font-weight": "FontWeightToken"
}
```

## Technical Details

### File Processing
- Scans HTML files for class attributes
- Supports directory traversal (excludes node_modules)
- Processes breakpoints in mobile-first order

### Error Handling
- Detailed error messages
- Stack trace management
- Graceful error recovery during parsing

### Token Types
- ColorToken
- SpacingToken
- FontSizeToken
- FontFamilyToken
- LineHeightToken
- LetterSpacingToken
